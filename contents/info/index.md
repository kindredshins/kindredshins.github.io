Kindred Shins are flamboyant, gun totting, smut peddling troubadours who's ability to create myths
are legendary. They were first flung together for the Winter Olympics of 1988 for the Jamaican
bobsled team, they produced a blistering performance, setting a world record pace before their
accident cruelly robbed them of their deserved medal.

Despite their success and returning to their homeland as heroes the work quickly dried up, after a
series of ill fated business ventures and the untimely death of John Candy they found themselves
living on the mean streets of trench town.

They quickly formed a skiffle band and played to the local trampista to hone their skills before
taking their act to the local cabaret shows around town, due to their acerbic charm and grotesquely
pretty features they started to gain notoriety and also reclaim their riches and social standing.

At first they succumbed to the pleasures of the flesh, ending their famine of decadence, they soon
came to the conclusion that they were old too soon and smart too late. They decided to donate all
the money they were making to Adin Drakmer and continued to live on the streets and make the music
that you listen to today.

They are renowned for being lethal on the dance floor and are historically a letdown in the bedroom
but don't let that put you off trying to be the first one to coax a resounding performance out of
them.

Someone, somewhere, wins the lottery every single day...
